## Overview

This project was developed to efficiently track shipping data, costs, delivery speed, and serial numbers of products shipped. The goal was to analyze shipping performance and costs to determine the best carrier options for various shipping zones, optimizing both delivery speed and expenses.

## Problem Statement

The main questions we aimed to answer with this tracking sheet were:
- Which carrier offers the fastest delivery times for our shipments?
- What are the most commonly shipped zones?
- What are the average shipping costs per carrier, and which is the most cost-effective?
- How does shipping speed vary across different geographic zones?

## Data Analysis

Based on the data provided:

- **Carrier Performance**: Analysis shows that **FedEx** had the fastest average delivery time at 4.9 days compared to **UPS** at 6.2 days. This suggests that FedEx may be the preferred carrier for urgent shipments.

- **Most Common Shipping Zones**: The data reveals that Zone 8 is the most frequently shipped zone, accounting for 46.2% of all shipments, followed by Zone 7 at 11.7%. Understanding these patterns allows for targeted strategies to optimize shipping processes and carrier choices in these zones.

- **Zone Analysis**: With an average delivery time of 5.8 days for Zone 8 and 5.1 days for Zone 7, optimizing carrier choice and shipping methods for these zones could lead to further cost and time savings.

## Tools and Techniques Used

- **VLOOKUPs**: Utilized extensively to match and retrieve shipping data based on tracking numbers and model types.
- **Workspace Integrations**: Integrated external shipment tracking systems to automatically pull real-time tracking data into the sheet, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.
- **Dynamic Formulas**: Implemented formulas to calculate shipping costs, delivery speeds, and analyze data based on multiple criteria, providing a comprehensive view of logistics performance.

## Results and Conclusion

The shipping tracker provided actionable insights that facilitated better decision-making in carrier selection and cost management for the company's shipping team. By highlighting the most efficient carriers and zones, the tool enabled the team to optimize shipping operations and reduce overall costs. This project demonstrates proficiency in data analysis, Excel functions, and workflow integrations, providing a valuable tool for optimizing logistics and business strategies.
